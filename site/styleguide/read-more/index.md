# Read More 

Read More/Read Less is a reusable widget that allows you to hide and then reveal longer pieces of text by clicking on a Read More button. The text that is revealed is given a class
name of "read-more". The Read More button will toggle between two modes, switching the Label accordingly. This is actually achieved by truncating the initial text at the first space, and appending either "More" or "Less".

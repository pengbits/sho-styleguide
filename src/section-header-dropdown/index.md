# Section Header with DropDown
The section header with dropdown combines the existing section header with a select element, aka a native drop-down. The immediate use-case is for the series season navigation, where the section header above the season slider can be opened to reveal a list of seasons.
 

<div class="section-header--dropdown">
  <select> 
    <option>Season 8</option>
    <option>Season 7</option>
    <option>Season 6</option>
    <option>Season 5</option>
    <option>Season 4</option>
    <option>Season 3</option>
    <option>Season 2</option>
    <option>Season 1</option>
  </select>
</div>

```

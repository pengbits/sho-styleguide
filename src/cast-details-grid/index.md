# Cast Page Grid

sho.com/{{series name}}/cast

A grid that displays series cast members, with links to indiviual cast member pages. Grid is displayed 4 across at desktop and 2 across at mobile, with sections for main cast members, then "New to Season X" sections for additional cast members in the order in which they appear. A user can jump to different sections via a "Jump To" dropdown menu at mobile width. Grid is built using CSS Grid, with flexbox as a fallback for IE11.

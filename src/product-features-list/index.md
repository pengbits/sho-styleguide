# Product Feature List
This is a placeholder entry to capture the order-specific (and so far, only) use-case for the block-list component. 

> The block-list is a pattern for rendering content as chunky list items at mobile, and as a 4-up grid at larger sizes. It is used in the stream showtime page to describe the attributes of the service (a value proposition), with each item getting a custom icon.

For more see the entry for [block-list](/styleguide/block-list) in components section.
